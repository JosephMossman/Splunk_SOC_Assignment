# Splunk_SOC_Assignment

- In this activity, I played the role of a SOC analyst hired by Virutal Space Industries (VSI) tasked with using Splunk to monitor against potential attacks from JobeCorp.


## Activity File: Part 1 - Master of the SOC

- Each group is playing the role of an SOC analyst at a small company called Virtual Space Industries (VSI), which designs virtual reality programs for businesses.

- VSI has heard rumors that a competitor, JobeCorp, may be launching cyberattacks to disrupt VSI's business.

- As SOC analysts, you are tasked with using Splunk to monitor against potential attacks on your systems and applications.

- Your Networking team has provided you with past logs to help you develop baselines and create reports, alerts, and dashboards.

You've been provided the following logs:

- **Windows Server Logs**

   - This server contains intellectual property of VSI's next-generation virtual reality programs.
   - [Windows Server Logs](Resources/windows_server_logs.csv)
   - [Windows Server Attack Logs](Resources/windows_server_attack_logs.csv)

- **Apache Server Logs**

   - This server is used for VSI's main public-facing website vsi-company.com.
   - [Apache Logs](Resources/apache_logs.txt)
   - [Apache Attack Logs](Resources/apache_attack_logs.txt)


### Windows Server Logs Instructions and Deliverables

1. Load the logs into your Splunk environment.

   - Select all default options provided.
   - **Important**: For the time range, select **All Time**.

2. Analyze the logs and the available fields.

3. Design the following deliverables to protect VSI from potential attacks by JobeCorp.

   - **Reports**: Design the following reports to assist VSI with quickly identifying specific information.

       - A report with a table of signatures and associated SignatureID.

           - This will allow VSI to easily view reports that show the ID number with a specific signature of the Windows activity.

             **Hint**: Research how to remove the duplicate values in your SPL search.

         `source="windows_server_logs.csv" | table signature signature_id | dedup signature`

         ![sig_sigid](Screenshots/part1_win/sig_sigid_report.png)

       - A report that provides the count and percent of the severity.

           - This will allow VSI to quickly know the severity levels of the Windows logs being viewed.

         `source="windows_server_logs.csv" | top severity`

         ![severity](Screenshots/part1_win/severity_report.png)

       - A report that provides a comparison between the success and failure of Windows activities.

           - This will show VSI if there is a suspicious level of failed activities on their server.

             **Hint**: Check the `status` field for this information.

         `source="windows_server_logs.csv" status=failure`
 
         ![sucess_failure](Screenshots/part1_win/success_failure_report.png)

   - **Alerts**: Design the following alerts to notify VSI of suspicious activity:

       - Determine a baseline and threshold for hourly level of failed Windows activity.

           - Create an alert to trigger when the threshold has been reached.
           - The alert should trigger an email to SOC@VSI-company.com.

               - Baseline for failed hourly attempts: 6.
               - Threshold for failed hourly attempts: 15.

         `source="windows_server_logs.csv" status=failure`
 
         ![sus_activity](Screenshots/part1_win/sus_activity_alert_final.png)

       - Determine a baseline and threshold for hourly count of the signature: an account was successfully logged on.

           - Create an alert to trigger when the threshold has been reached.
           - The alert should trigger an email to SOC@VSI-company.com.

               - Baseline for hourly success of logged on accounts: 12.
               - Threshold for hourly success of logged on accounts: 30.

         `source="windows_server_logs.csv" signature="An account was successfully logged on"`

         ![success](Screenshots/part1_win/success_alert_final.png)

       - Determine a baseline and threshold for hourly count of the signature: a user account was deleted.

           - Design the alert based on the corresponding SignatureID, as the signature name sometimes changes when the Windows system updates.
           - Create an alert to trigger when the threshold has been reached.
           - The alert should trigger an email to SOC@VSI-company.com.

               - Baseline for hourly deleted user accounts: 13. 
               - Threshold for hourly deleted user accounts: 50.

         `source="windows_server_logs.csv" signature_id=4726`

         ![deleted](Screenshots/part1_win/deleted_account_alert_final.png)

   - **Visualizations and Dashboards**: Design the following visualizations and add them to a dashboard called Windows Server Monitoring:

       **Hint**: Add the following after your search: `timechart span=1h count by signature`.

       - A line chart that displays the different `signature` field values over time.

**Dashboard Analysis for URI Data**

Analyze your dashboard panel of the URI data and answer the following questions:

Does anything stand out as suspicious?

There was suspicious activity with the URI “/files/logstash/logstash-1.3.2-monolithic.jar” from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday, March 25th and with the URI “/VSI_Account_logon.php” from 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on Wednesday, March 25th.

What URI is hit the most?

The URI “/VSI_Account_logon.php” was hit the most with 1,415 events.

Based on the URI being accessed, what could the attacker potentially be doing?

Based on the URI “VSI_Logon.php” being accessed, the attacker may be trying to brute force the VSI logon page. 

##Activity File: Part 3 - Protecting VSI from Future Attacks

In the previous part, you set up your SOC and monitored attacks from JobeCorp. Now, you will need to design mitigation strategies to protect VSI from future attacks.


You are tasked with using your findings from the Master of SOC activity to answer questions about mitigation strategies.

System

You will be using the Splunk app located in the Ubuntu VM.

Logs

Use the same log files you used during the Master of SOC activity:
Windows Logs
Windows Attack Logs
Apache WebServer Logs
Apache WebServer Attack Logs

###Part 1: Windows Server Attack

Note: This is a public-facing windows server that VSI employees access.

**Question 1**

Several users were impacted during the attack on March 25th.

user_a

The “user_a” user was responsible for the “A user account was locked out” signature.

This signature indicates the attacker was trying to brute force attack into the user_a account.

The password for user_a should be changed to a new, complex password to remove unintended access to this account.

If the user_a account continues to be locked out, user_a could be changed to a different user name.

user_k

The user “user_k” was responsible for the “An attempt was made to reset an accounts password” signature.

There was no evidence of success by the attacker of resetting the password to gain access into the account.

The alert thresholds for the user_k account should be edited with lower alert threshold settings as a mitigation solution for future attacks.

Based on the attack signatures, what mitigations would you recommend to protect each user account? Provide global mitigations that the whole company can use and individual mitigations that are specific to each user.
A global mitigation solution would be to allow whitelisting to specific user accounts based on their respective source IP Addresses.
Another mitigation solution would be to lower the alert thresholds of the user_a and user_k accounts.

**Question 2**

VSI has insider information that JobeCorp attempted to target users by sending "Bad Logins" to lock out every user.

The Sysadmin should set up an account locked out duration policy. The account lockout duration policy setting establishes time value parameters to accounts that have become locked out.

What sort of mitigation could you use to protect against this?

Extending the time required before a locked out account can be unlocked.

Lowering the alert thresholds of accounts becoming locked out..

###Part 2: Apache Webserver Attack:

**Question 1**

Based on the geographic map, recommend a firewall rule that the networking team should implement.

Provide a "plain english" description of the rule.

For example: "Block all incoming HTTP traffic where the source IP comes from the city of Los Angeles."

Provide a screenshot of the geographic map that justifies why you created this rule.

The attack is occurring in Ukraine, specifically the cities of Kiev and Kharkiv.

Provide a "plain english" description of the rule.

Rule: Block all incoming HTTP traffic where the source IP comes from the country of Ukraine."

**Question 2**

VSI has insider information that JobeCorp will launch the same web server attack but use a different IP each time in order to avoid being stopped by the rule you just created.

What other rules can you create to protect VSI from attacks against your webserver?

Conceive of two more rules in "plain english".
Hint: Look for other fields that indicate the attacker. 

VSI could look into two other fields “useragent” and “bytes” to identify the attacker.

useragent Mozilla/4.0: Peak count of 1,296 events.


useragent Chef Client/10.18.2: Peak count of 624 events. 



byte 65748: Peak count of 1,296 events.

byte 324: Peak count of 624 events.

Rule 1: firewall parameters designed to stop further attacks.

Block all incoming HTTP traffic from the useragent "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727987787; InfoPath.1).”

Block all incoming HTTP traffic where the bytes count is 65748.

Rule 2: firewall parameters designed to stop further attacks.

Block all incoming HTTP traffic from the useragent “Chef Client/10.18.2 
(ruby-1.9.3-p327; ohai-6.16.0; x86_64-linux; +http://opscode.com).”

Block all incoming HTTP traffic where the bytes count is 324.
